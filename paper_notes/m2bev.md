tl;dr: Multitask multicam with improved LSS.

#### Overall impression
Describe the overall impression of the paper. 

#### Key ideas
- Summaries of the key ideas

#### Technical details
- **Joint training** slightly hurts the performance of each task. We observe that the location distribution of objects and maps do not have strong correlation, e.g. many cars are not in the drivable area. --> This is also observed in [BEVFusion](bevfusion.md) and [PETRv2](petrv2.md).

#### Notes
- Questions and notes on how to improve/revise the current work
