# [On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)

tl;dr: Nice def and summary of FM. 

#### Overall impression
* A foundation model is any model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks
* The significance of foundation models can be summarized by two words: **emergence** and **homogenization**. 
    * Emergence means that the behavior of a system is implicitly induced rather than explicitly constructed;
    * Homogenization indicates the consolidation of methodologies for building machine learning systems across a wide range of applications
