# [MPDM2: Multipolicy Decision-Making for Autonomous Driving via Changepoint-based Behavior Prediction](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss11/p43.pdf)

_June 2024_

tl;dr: Improvement of MPDM in predicting the intention of other vehicles.

#### Overall impression
The majority is the same as the previous work [MPDM](mpdm.md). There is a follow up article on this as well [MPDM3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-017-9619-z) which expands [MPDM2](mpdm2.md) with more experiments, but with the same methodology.

So the main idea of MPDM is already covered in the original short paper [MPDM](mpdm.md).

#### Key ideas
- Motion prediction of other agents with a classical ML methods (Maximum likelihood estimation).

#### Technical details
- Summary of technical details, such as important training details, or bugs of previous benchmarks.

#### Notes
- Questions and notes on how to improve/revise the current work
