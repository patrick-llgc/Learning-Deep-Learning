# Paper notes
This repository contains my paper reading notes on deep learning and machine learning. It is inspired by [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes) and [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes). A minimalistic webpage generated with Github io can be found [here](https://patrick-llgc.github.io/Learning-Deep-Learning/).

## About me
My name is [Patrick Langechuan Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-llgc/). After about a decade of education and research in physics, I found my passion in deep learning and autonomous driving. Currently I am leading the development of perception features at [Xpeng Motors](https://en.xiaopeng.com/), a fast growing autonomous driving company.


## What to read
If you are new to deep learning in computer vision and don't know where to start, I suggest you spend your first month or so dive deep into [this list of papers](start/first_cnn_papers.md). I did so ([see my notes](start/first_cnn_papers_notes.md)) and it served me well.

Here is [a list of trustworthy sources of papers](trusty.md) in case I ran out of papers to read.
